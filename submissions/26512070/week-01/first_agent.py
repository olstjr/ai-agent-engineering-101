"""Week 01 starter — OpenAI-compatible API version (works with OpenRouter).

Two tools: calculator, read_file. Your assignment: add a third.
Requires: pip install openai, and in the environment:
  OPENAI_API_KEY   your key (an OpenRouter key works)
  OPENAI_BASE_URL  optional; set to https://openrouter.ai/api/v1 for OpenRouter
  AGENT_MODEL      optional; defaults to gpt-4o-mini. For OpenRouter free
                   models use e.g. AGENT_MODEL=meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free
