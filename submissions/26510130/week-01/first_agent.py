"""Week 01 — the lab agent with a third tool: list_files.

Three tools: calculator, read_file, list_files.
OpenAI-compatible API version, pointed at OpenRouter.

Requires: pip install openai, and in the environment:
  OPENAI_API_KEY   your OpenRouter key
  OPENAI_BASE_URL  https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
  AGENT_MODEL      optional; defaults to minimax/minimax-m3:free

Sampling is pinned in code: temperature=0.0. See TOOLS.md.

Run:
    python first_agent.py
    python first_agent.py "your own goal here"

    # notes.txt. The two added sentences say what the listing means and what to
    # do when no name matches. See TOOLS.md.
