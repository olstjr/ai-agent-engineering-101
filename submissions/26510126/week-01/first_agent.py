"""Week 01 — OpenAI-compatible API version, run against OpenRouter.

Three tools: calculator, read_file, write_note.
Requires: pip install openai, and in the environment:
  OPENAI_API_KEY   your key (an OpenRouter key works)
  OPENAI_BASE_URL  set to https://openrouter.ai/api/v1 for OpenRouter
  AGENT_MODEL      optional; overrides the default set below

Run:
  python first_agent.py "Read notes.txt, sum the numbers, and record the total back into notes.txt"

That string is also the default when no argument is given.

write_note appends, so notes.txt gains a line on every run. Restore it with
`git checkout notes.txt` before re-running — otherwise the input no longer
matches the one the logs in logs/ were captured against.

Note: the model example in the original starter
(meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free) is no longer listed on OpenRouter.
Verified working free models with tool calling, 2026-09-01:
  minimax/minimax-m2.7:free    (the default; every log in logs/ used this)
  cohere/north-mini-code:free

RUNS.md maps each log to the model, code state and goal string behind it.
